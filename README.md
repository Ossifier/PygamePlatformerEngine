# PygamePlatformerEngine
A simple 2D platformer engine written in Python/Pygame. Contains some simple souls-like elements such as stamina handling for flavor, but this logic may be removed in a future branch.

## IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT NOTICE:
This code has been significantly restructured due to troublesome bugs that arose from the prior engine. If for some reason you need this old code, it can be retrieved as one of the branches for this project. Both the interp and non-interp versions are preserved.

This project now used an engine design more similar to DaFluffyPotato's engine, mainly for performance reasons. However, over time, significant changes to the engine are planned.
