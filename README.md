# PygamePlatformerEngine
A 2D platformer engine written in Python/Pygame.

The engine itself is inteded to be used in creating a platformer that will ideally include the following features:

1. A large, explorable world with a dynamic tracking camera.
2. Modifiable player powerups and upgrades, most notably those that are related to mobility such as jump height, double/triple jumps, speed, ect.
3. Weapons that alter the player's movement pool.
4. An experience system tied to defeating enemies with particular weapons that unlocks new abilities.
5. Most importantly, something fun, engaging, and worth playing.

This is a long-term project with no projected end-date.
