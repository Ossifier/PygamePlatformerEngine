# PygamePlatformerEngine
A 2D platformer engine written in Python/Pygame.

## TO DO:
1. Implement functionality to gather information on the player state (idling, running, jumping, falling, attacking, taking damage, ect.)
2. Implement a way to control sprites and animations.
3. Tighten the current player tracking camera so that feels much smoother for the player.
4. Add more detailed comments in the code so that its purpose is more clear (this is important for future development of features).
5. Start thinking about level design and zone transitions.
