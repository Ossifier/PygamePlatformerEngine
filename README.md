# PygamePlatformerEngine
A simple 2D platformer engine written in Python/Pygame.

## TO DO:
1. Implement functionality to gather information on the player state (idling, running, jumping, falling, attacking, taking damage, ect.)
2. Implement a way to control sprites and animations.
3. Tighten the current player tracking camera so that feels much smoother for the player.
4. Start thinking about level design and zone transitions.

## IN PROGRESS:
1. Refactor the code so the code is more understandable, and so that adding additional future features is easier to manage.
2. Create sprites and assets for the game (ongoing).

## DONE:
1. Add more detailed comments in the code so that its purpose is more clear (this is important for future development of features).
